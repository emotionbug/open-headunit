# Connection lifecycle regressions

Run `python3 app/src/test/host-connection/run.py` after populating Gradle's Kotlin dependencies.
The runner extracts production lifecycle methods and uses JVM queues and latches to exercise
cancellation, ownership publication, full worker termination and USB open/close races.
Android framework and I/O endpoints are test doubles; no device is needed.

When the playback host suite is present, the runner also exercises the settings/publication
boundary with the real AapAudio and AudioDecoder owners. This optional integration check
retains standalone execution of the connection PR without a playback dependency.
It also exercises scan-control calls from the extracted connection observer with the real
route policy and strategy enum. Recording doubles replace the launcher and Shizuku APIs:
Direct/Hotspot startup, skipped live phases, disconnect/error, replacement connection identity,
USB/loopback/non-native exclusion and the Android 8 SDK gate are covered without radio changes.

## CI and local execution

Android CI runs this tool after Gradle's unit tests in the **Unit tests (github debug)** job.
A harness failure fails that job. The `host-connection-diagnostics` artifact retains its log,
extracted Kotlin sources and method/toolchain metadata, including on failure.

For local lifecycle changes, run `./gradlew :app:testGithubDebugUnitTest` first to populate
the Kotlin dependency cache, then `python3 app/src/test/host-connection/run.py`.
The Gradle task alone does not run the harness. The full runner includes the Self launch
suite, which can also be run separately with `python3 app/src/test/host-connection/self-launch.py`
after the first full run.

Production member lookup uses exact declarations; a missing or renamed member raises an
error and must be updated together with its fixture. These tools complement JVM unit tests.
